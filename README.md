# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

This is a collection of AI Lectures given by me  [Ali Talib](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aliasgertalib) at [MoCoMakers events](https://www.meetup.com/MoCoMakers).

The lectures were hosted by [Montgomery County Makers (MoCo Makers)](http://www.mocomakers.com/) based in the [Rockville Memorial Library](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Rockville+Town+Square+Plaza%2C+30+Maryland+Ave%2C+Rockville%2C+MD%2C+us).


## Lectures
- [Lecture 1](https://www.meetup.com/MoCoMakers/events/mdxsppyxhbrb/): In first lecture, I  gave  an introduction into the concept of neural networks esp Convolution Neural Nets.
- [Lecture 2](https://www.meetup.com/MoCoMakers/events/mdxsppyxhbkc/): We had deep dive into the code for shallow and deep networks, comparing the accuracy of the two.
- [Lecture 3](https://www.meetup.com/MoCoMakers/events/mdxsppyxjbnb/): This lecture introduced us to Adversarial attacks that can be done against neural networks. We were also introduced to the principles behind Generative Adversarial Networks.
- [Lecture 4](https://www.meetup.com/MoCoMakers/events/251157875/): As  MakerSpace room was not available, This lecture was conducted in teh hallway and a study room on a notepad and pencil. I talked about GlobalAveragePooling layer, and explained about  GAN, how they work and why they are useful.
- [Lecture 45](https://www.meetup.com/MoCoMakers/events/251136836/)Basic Introduction to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANS). 
Demo MNIST - GAN and Celebretiy Faces GAN. Demo Programs were from the internet, Github links were provided.
